# TechDegreeProject-6

This project required the use of at least two npm modules for completion.

I used "scrape-it" for my scraping module. It has over 1000 downloads, and it was last updated 4 months ago. (as of project completion 8/30/18)
I used "csv-stringify" for my csv creation module. It has over 1000 downloads, and it was last updated 2 days ago. (as of project completion 8/30/18)

I have also included a scraper-error.log file which gets appended with each error, and the start script to run the program with npm start for extra credit.

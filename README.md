# TechDegreeProject-6

This project introduces Node.js as a runtime environment capable of running programs written in JavaScript outside of the browser and its default package manager NPM. I used two npm packages along with Node native packages to create a content scraper.

### What does it do?

This program enables a user to easily scrape specific price information from a fictional e-commerce website. This program's intended use would be to run it once daily to collect csv price data and save that data to a .csv file which would eventually be used in additional steps for data analysis.

### Additional Project Info for Grading

This project required the use of at least two npm modules for completion.

I used "scrape-it" for my scraping module. It has over 1000 downloads, and it was last updated 4 months ago. (as of project completion 8/30/18)
I used "csv-stringify" for my csv creation module. It has over 1000 downloads, and it was last updated 2 days ago. (as of project completion 8/30/18)

I have also included a scraper-error.log file which gets appended with each error, and the start script to run the program with npm start for extra credit.
